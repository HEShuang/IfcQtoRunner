## Overview

**IfcQtoRunner** is a C++/Qt application for working with IFC files. It allows you to:

* **Import and Explore** Import IFC files to display the project structure and explore the properties of each building element. (‚úÖ Done)
* **Live 3D Visualization** Visualize the 3D model in real-time during the import process. (‚úÖ Done)
* **Quantity Take-Offs** Compute standard IFC quantities (‚öôÔ∏è Ongoing)
* **Mobile Support** Port the application to mobile platforms (üöß Upcoming)
  
## Purpose

* **Support evolving IFC standards** ‚Äî adapt easily to new schema versions (IFC2x3, IFC4.x, future IFC5 ‚Ä¶)
* **Use modern C++** ‚Äî C++17/20 features, multi-threading, move semantics, efficient containers
* **Enable fast quantity take‚Äëoff** ‚Äî rapid standard IFC quantity computations for AEC workflows

## Features

* **Structure Preview**: Browse building hierarchies down to storeys and elements
* **Geometry Viewer**: 3D rendering powered by Qt OpenGL
* **Progressive Rendering**: Rendering while importing
* **Quantity Take‚Äëoff**: Ongoing feature for automated quantity calculation
